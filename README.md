Overview of the Project
Functions:
1.	get_letter_grade(average):
o	Takes a student's average score as input and returns the corresponding letter grade.
o	Grading scale:
	90 and above: A
	80 to 89: B
	70 to 79: C
	60 to 69: D
	Below 60: F
2.	calculate_gpa(letter_grade):
o	Converts a letter grade (A to F) into the corresponding GPA value using a 4.0 scale.
	A: 4.0
	B: 3.0
	C: 2.0
	D: 1.0
	F: 0.0
3.	grade_manager():
o	Manages the entire grade input process:
	Prompts the user to enter the number of subjects.
	Accepts the grade for each subject.
	Calculates the average grade.
	Displays the letter grade and GPA based on the calculated average.
Output Example:
In the example run:
•	The user inputs grades for multiple subjects.
•	The program calculates the average grade (e.g., 68.75), which results in a letter grade of 'D' and a GPA of 1.0.
This project provides a simple, interactive way for students to calculate their overall grades and GPA based on inputted subject grades
